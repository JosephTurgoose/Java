# Overview

I made a simple Java gui framework that works as a very basic calculator.  I did this all from scratch instead of importing a special module to assist with calculator logic in order to better learn how to create the interactions I wanted to have.

The purpose of this project was to challenge myself to learn Java within two weeks while also working and doing school full time.  I wanted to see how far I could get with an unfamiliar system and this is the result.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code is the environment in which I completed this project.

I solely used Java for this project, with the following imports:
- import javax.swing.*;
- import java.awt.*;
- import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
- import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
- import java.util.regex.Pattern;

# Useful Websites

As usual, ChatGPT came in handy when trying to find a fast answer of how to do something.  I also found several YouTube videos to be very helpful, most particularly the short listed below on how to begin a Java GUI framework.

# Future Work

Some things I would like to fix and improve in the future for this application are as follows:

- Implement better support for working with floats and doubles.
- Upgrade the GUI design to be more professional and enticing.
- Make this project into an application that I can install directly onto a computer and run by opening it.
